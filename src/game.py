class Game:

    def __init__(self):

        """

        Takes care of the main components of the game.

        ### Entity component system:
        This class initializes with a new entity component system which can
        be accessed via the pool attribute.

        ### Game map:
        After the game map was initialized, the attributes game_map and
        game_map_id will be set to reference the game map entity and
        game map entity id. Initialize the game map with the init_game_map
        method. Other parts of the game may try to access these attributes and
        raise a RuntimeError in case the game map was not initialized.

        ### Player:
        After the player was initialized, the attributes player and player_id
        will be set to reference the player entity and the player entity
        id. Initialize the player entity with the init_player method. Other
        parts of the game may try to access these attributes and raise a
        RuntimeError in case the player entity was not initialized.

        ### Blueprints:
        After the blueprint book was initialized, the blueprint book can be
        accessed via the blueprints attribute. Initialize the blueprint book
        with the init_blueprints method. Other parts of the game may try to
        access this attribute and raise a RuntimeError in case it the blueprint
        book was not initialized. See the doc string of the init_blueprints
        method to learn more about the structure of the blueprint book.

        ### Curses windows:
        The render method will create the curses windows for the game map, the
        log and the player information and saves them to a dictionary which can
        be accessed via the base_windows attribute.

        ### Config:
        After a config file was loaded, the created dictionary can be accessed
        via the config attribute. Load a config file with the load_config
        method.
        Other parts of the game may try to access this attribute and raise a
        RuntimeError in case no config file was loaded. Config files should be
        json files with keywords representing non static components of
        the game. TODO write doc for the config file.

        ### Game state:
        The attribute state consists of a string representing the current
        state of the game. This class initializes with the state "normal".
        Depending of the game state the render and perform_input methods will
        behave differently.
        If the state is set to "exit", the game will quit.
        TODO create set_game_state method, maybe replace
        the string with enums.

        ### Game rounds:
        The attribute round consists of an integer that is meant to track
        the number of the current ingame round. This attribute
        initializes with the value 0.

        ### Game Log:
        The attribute log consists of a list that should only contain strings.
        The here contained strings will be displayed in the log window while
        the game state is set to "normal".

        ### Terminal Colors:
        This class will initialize with a base set of eight colors that add up
        to a total of 64 color pair numbers which stored inside of a dictionary.
        These colors are: white, black, blue, yellow, red, green, magenta,
        cyan. The color pair numbers can be accessed via the colors attribute
        using keywords representing the background and foreground colors.
        Example: self.colors["white"]["black"] # first keyword = foreground,
        second keyword = background

        ### Map Pointer:
        The map pointer is the point on the map the camera is centered on.
        It consists of a tuple containing two integers which is stored
        in the pointer_pos attribute and is initially set to (0, 0).
        The attribute pointer_bound consists of a bool and is initially set to
        False. If it is set to True the camera will centered on the entity
        represented by the id stored in the pointer_entity attribute.
